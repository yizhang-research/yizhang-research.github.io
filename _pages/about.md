I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong. I am IEEE Senior Member, Academic Advisory Group Member of the International Energy Agency (IEA) 4E program power electronics platform. I am one of the co-funder of the ReliaPE Aps, which is a spin-off start-up providing reliability assessment tools for power electronics.

I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, supervised by Prof. Dianguo Xu, in 2014 and 2016, respectively. I received his Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University, Denmark, supervised by Prof. Frede Blaabjerg and Prof. Huai Wang, in 2020. All degrees are in electrical engineering. Prior to joining PolyU, I has worked as an Assistant Professor with Aalborg University, Denmark, during 2023-2024. During 2020-2023, I was affiliated with multiple institutions as a DFF International Postdoctoral Research Fellow, including RWTH Aachen University, Germany, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. I was also a visiting scholar with Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, in 2018. My research focuses on advancing the reliability and sustainability of power electronics through design, testing, packaging, and condition monitoring. 
    
I am also the Guest Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics. I am recipient of the First Place Prize Paper Award of the IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics in 2021, and the IEEE Power Electronics Society Ph.D. Thesis Award in 2020.
