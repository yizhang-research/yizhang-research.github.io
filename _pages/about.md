I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-zhang-yi/?sc_lang=en)ï¼ŒHong Kong.  
Before joining PolyU, I was an Assistant Professor in [Aalborg University](https://www.energy.aau.dk/), Denmark, where I worked on power electronics reliability and advanced packaging in collaboration with industry, including Siemens, Danfoss, ABB, Hitachi Energy, Vestas, Infineon, CRRC, Nexperia, just name a few.

My research focuses on advancing the reliability and sustainability of power electronics through design, testing, packaging, and condition monitoring.

## RESEARCH

My current research focuses on power electronics reliability via the following aspects:

- AI-assisted power electronics design automation
- Thermal and reliability characterization for power semiconductor switches
- Sustainable and recyclable packaging technologies for power electronics
- Reliability and failure analysis of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices  
- Condition health monitoring of power electronics systems (e.g., grid-connected converters, electric vehicles, locomotives)

## OPENINGS

ðŸŽ“ I am always looking for highly motivated students and collaborators.

- PhD, MPhi, and Postdoc positions available in the areas of power electronics, WBG packaging, prognostics and health management (PHM), and AI-assisted modeling
- Visiting students including BS, MS, and PhD students are welcome to reach out

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining my group or collaborating on related topics.
