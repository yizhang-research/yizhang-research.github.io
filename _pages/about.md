## BIO

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-zhang-yi/?sc_lang=en).  
Before joining PolyU, I was an Assistant Professor in Aalborg University, Denmark, where I worked on power electronics reliability and packaging innovations in collaboration with industry.

My research focuses on advancing the reliability and sustainability of power electronics through design, testing, packaging, and condition monitoring.

## RESEARCH

My current research focuses on:

- AI-assisted power electronics design automation
- Thermal and reliability characterization for power semiconductor switches
- Sustainable and recyclable packaging technologies for power electronics
- Reliability and failure analysis of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices  
- Condition health monitoring of power electronics systems (e.g., grid-connected converters, electric vehicles, locomotives)
