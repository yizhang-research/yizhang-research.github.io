## Theme 1: A New Method to Identify the Internal Structure of Power Semiconductor Packaging

![Thermal image](/images/themes/thermal.png){: style="max-width:300px; margin-bottom:10px;" }

Power semiconductor switches are black-box packaging with limited electrical terminals only. If we can utilize these electrical terminals to identify the internal structures, it provides important values for power electronics industry, such as quality checking of device fabrication, designs of power converters, and field operation and maintenance. The current industry relies on the JEDEC 51-14 standard to achieve this requirement, a method proposed nearly 30 years ago. However, this approach falls short in the era of wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors due to several key limitations:

1. **Mathematical Ill-posedness**: The traditional method is unstable in the high-frequency range, forcing low-pass filtering that removes valuable structural detail.
2. **Lack of Resolution**: WBG devices use thinner chips and finer structures, which require significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution than the standard method can provide.
3. **Invalid Assumptions**: Modern packaging technologies (e.g., double-sided cooling, integrated 3D structures) violate the one-dimensional heat flow assumptions underpinning the JEDEC method.

Our research proposes a new thermal transient evaluation method that overcomes these limitations using sparsity-promoting reconstruction techniques in the time domain.



Understanding the physics of transient thermal responses enables reproducible reliability characterization of WBG devices.
